Intended to become a better Hearthstone one day...

this is a short explenation of how to add a card:
First locate the Karte.txt File in the main Folder and open it.

to show how this file is structured let me use an example:
Geralt of Riva;M;L;1;9;7

The Name of the card is Geralt of Riva.
A cards name should be about this long and can have spaces as in this case.

M stands for Monster, but since this is the only Typ of card at the moment there is no choice here

L stands for Legendary. The Card Images used as Texture have either white or black as background. 
By setting this to L it paints the mana cost of the card as white number, otherwise in black.

Next are the three major balance values.
First there is the mana cost, setting this low should lessen the value of this card.
Next there is the Damage and finally Life. HF
